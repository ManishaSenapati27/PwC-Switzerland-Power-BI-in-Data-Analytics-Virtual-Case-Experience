# PwC-Switzerland-Power-BI-in-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Case-Experience
I am excited to share my recent experience with PwC Switzerland's Power BI Virtual Case, where I had the opportunity to dive deep into the realm of data visualization and analysis. The case revolved around three crucial areas: Call Centre Trends, Customer Retention, and Diversity & Inclusion. Let me take you through my journey of crafting impactful dashboards that unveiled valuable insights.

# Task 1: Call Centre Trends
Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction 

Overall calls answered/abandoned

Calls by time

Average speed of answer

Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

# Task 2: Customer Retention
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them

The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination

Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk

We have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end

We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

# Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

number of men

number of women

number of leavers

% employees promoted (FY21)

% of women promoted

% of hires men

% of hires women

% turnover

Average performance rating: men

Average Performance rating: women
